Badges
======

- Add supported compiler badges (GCC, CLANG)
- Add supported C++ versions (11, 14, 17, etc)
- Need to make it so we can have multiple testing files, not just one. But how? Probably cmake or a custom function

- Add docstrings to every function
- Change the macros to be not abbreviated?
