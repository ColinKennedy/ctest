- Need to make it so we can have multiple testing files, not just one. But how? Probably cmake or a custom function


GitHub Test Runners
===================

Jason Turner template
https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/gui_starter_template/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml

- Get the code working in
 - Windows
 - MSVC

- Add more colors for statuses (e.g. [OK] == blue)

- Add docstrings to every function

- Change the macros to be not abbreviated?

- Add a cmake target that runs the unittests tests


Badges
======

- Add supported compiler badges (GCC, CLANG)
- Add supported C++ versions (11, 14, 17, etc)


Misc
====

- Make sure README badges work
- Add documentation (doxygen?)
- clangtidy
- cppcheck
- Update CI OS / compiler versions
- Do all TODO notes
